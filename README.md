# Overview
This is the middleware source code for the ETH course 'Advanced Systems Lab' (fall semester 2017).
The goal of this course was to develop a middleware between load generating Memtier clients and Memcached servers and perform an extensive system analysis when running different workloads.

# Get started
Compile/run middleware (and adjust parameters): `code/run_mw.sh`

or

Compile with ant: goto `code/middleware` and execute `ant -f build.xml`
Use Java 8+!
